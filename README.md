##  A Two-branch Neural Network for Non-homogeneous Dehazing via Ensemble Learning

This is the official PyTorch implementation of Two-branch Dehazing.  See more details in  [[report]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/NTIRE/papers/Ancuti_NTIRE_2021_NonHomogeneous_Dehazing_Challenge_Report_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf) , [[paper]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/NTIRE/papers/Yu_A_Two-Branch_Neural_Network_for_Non-Homogeneous_Dehazing_via_Ensemble_Learning_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf), [[certificates]](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire21/NTIRE2021awards_certificates.pdf)

Our method wins runner-up award in NTIRE 2021 Non-homogeneous Dehazing Challenge.

Training set is the one that we used during the competition.  Please be noted that we conduct gamma correction on NH-HAZE-2020. Test set is composed of random samples from the training set. The test set is used to provide effective training accuracy. If you want to obtain val and test accuracy on NH-HAZE-2021, please step towards the official [competition server.](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/28032#learn_the_details-overview)
